There is a widely known or widely recognized book titled "Java Oracle Black Book" related to Java programming or Oracle technologies. 
However, there are numerous books and resources available for learning Java programming and Oracle technologies, often with titles that reflect the content they cover.
If you are looking for resources related to Java and Oracle technologies, I recommend checking popular bookstores, online retailers, and educational websites for
the most up-to-date and relevant books and materials that suit your learning needs. 
Additionally, you can refer to Oracle's official documentation and Java's official documentation for detailed information on Java and Oracle technologies. 
If you have specific questions or topics you'd like to learn more about, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide information and guidance.
